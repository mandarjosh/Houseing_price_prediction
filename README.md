# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project, where we aim to estimate housing prices using machine learning models. This README provides an overview of the project, model performance, and recommendations for stakeholders.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict housing prices based on various factors such as area, bedrooms, and proximity to the main road. We have explored multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance.

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
1. **Predictive Capability**: Our models exhibit strong predictive capability, explaining a substantial portion of the target variable's variance.
2. **Generalization**: Models generalize well to unseen data, ensuring reliability for future property pricing.
3. **Relevance**: Models incorporate relevant predictors, maintaining simplicity and avoiding unnecessary variables.
4. **Improvement Opportunities**: While performance is good, there's room for further refinement to minimize prediction errors.
5. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Stakeholders can confidently use these models alongside domain expertise for pricing decisions.

### Top-Performing Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Linear Regression** emerge as the top-performing models, with KNN providing the highest accuracy.

## Recommendations

For pricing decisions, we recommend utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression models. These models have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities and generalization to new data.

## Further Enhancements

To further improve model accuracy and robustness, consider ongoing optimization and feature engineering. Collaborating with domain experts can also provide valuable insights.
